# Is Tau Bay Open

This is a simple website that uses twitter to allow patrons of Pho Tau Bay to report if the restaurant is open or if the staff is on vacation. Additionally the site provides some basic info such as the address, phone number, and regular restaurant hours.

### Design

This site was built using the [`generator-webapp`](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp) template from [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/generators/).

### Making Changes

* Run `grunt serve` to start a local web server that will automatically reload when changes are detected to the index file
* Run `grunt` to build the site and produce a `dist` folder
* Copy all files in `dist` to the remote server
