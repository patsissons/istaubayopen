<p>This site is in no way affiliated with <a href="http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pho-tau-bay-edmonton">Pho Tau Bay</a> in <a href="http://www.edmonton.ca/">Edmonton, Alberta, Canada</a>. It is here to provide its fans and patrons an easy way to know if the business is open, closed for the night, or if they're "<em>on vacation</em>." Tweet with the hashtag #istaubayopen (or use the buttons above) to let everyone know if <strong>The Bay</strong> is <strong>open</strong> or <strong>closed</strong>. <strong>:)</strong></p>
<p>This site is not directly related to the old <a href="http://istaubayopen.com">http://istaubayopen.com</a> site that is no longer in service, but rather is inspired to build upon the idea and improve the experience. If you visit <strong>Pho Tau Bay</strong>, please help everyone out and post a tweet that it's open or closed. Unfortunately, istaubayopen.com is not *<em>available for purchase</em>* (asking price is over $1,000 and I'm more than happy to continue using a .ca domain).</p>
